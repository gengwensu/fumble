# fumble
Fumble is a popular app that lets friends know when they cross paths. The mobile client sends the users long,lat to a post endpoint once a second, all day long. The user should be able to open the app at any point and see the people they've crossed paths with. 

# API:
fumble will run on http://localhost:3000 and will support the following REST APIs:
1. GET /fumble/

2. POST /fumble/location with data userId={userId}/long={longitude}/lat={latitude}
    will update the coordinate of users
